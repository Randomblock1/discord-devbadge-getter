# discord-devbadge-getter

Discord made a shiny new "Active Developer" badge which you can get by creating a bot that supports Global Commands. This shows you how to create a bot, but don't worry, it's super easy to use!

## Steps

1. Create a new temporary Discord server and enable Community (Server Settings > Community)
2. Either:
   - [Download the repo ZIP](https://github.com/Randomblock1/discord-devbadge-getter/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), then run `npm install` *OR*
   - Copy and paste [index.js](index.js) into [RunKit](https://npm.runkit.com/npm)
3. [Create a new Discord application](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
4. Copy "Application ID" into the first line of [index.js](index.js)
5. Go to the "Bot" tab and create an account
6. Click "Reset Token" to generate the token
7. Copy the token in the second line of [index.js](index.js)
8. Depending on which method you're using, either run `node index.js` OR press the Run button on RunKit (only works 1 minute at a time, be quick or press run again after it stops)
9. Go to `#general` and type `/continue`
10. Do what the bot says
11. Check out your shiny new badge!
12. Star the repo and follow me on GitHub if you found this useful!
